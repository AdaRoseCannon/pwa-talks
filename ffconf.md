[Convert to Slide Deck](#aslides)

Abstract: With new web technologies enabling a new generation of install-able app-like websites it is important to ensure the web carries on working for everyone. This talk will discuss the P in PWA, progressive web apps should work for everyone and should not let their app-like approach divorce them from the web.

## A quick example install of a Web App

I am going to make the assumption that everyone who managed to get tickets to FFConf keeps their ear to the ground WRT the web.

*Quick show of hands who here thinks they have a pretty good idea what a progressive web app is?*

A progressive web app at it's heart is a website.

That website is usually designed to appear native like.

The website will take advantage of new web platform features when they are available.

These features enable native like functionality such as working offline and push notifications.

<script>window.setDynamicSlide(window.playVideo);</script>
<blockquote class="dark">
<h1>A quick example of a web app:</h1>
<video src="images/add-to-homescreen.m4v" autoplay="true" muted></video>
</blockquote>

We must learn to accept that not all web platform features are available everywhere.

As much as we would love to give every user the same experience new browser features are not available everywhere yet.

That is okay.

## Web is declarative

The web is designed to be declarative.

It is designed to be interpreted depending on the platform.

*SpaceJam*

This is what allows websites written years ago work on devices which never existed at the time.

There are many other benefits to being web like which the current trend of reimplementing the browser's capabilities in JavaScript is throwing away.

## What about native apps?

Last week I was speaking at Moz Fest and we asked the audience for what they loved most about native platforms on iOS and Android

Here were their responses:

* Blah....

Today I would like to show many of you how these native-like features are no longer tied to native platform

And are available to use to build apps in the web today.

Allowing you to have your cake and eat it too!!
